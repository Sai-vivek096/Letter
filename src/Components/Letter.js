              <b>Dear AkkaðŸ–¤,<br /></b>
It feels like a part of me left when you went to Germany. The days longer, and I find myself missing your laugh, your advice, and even those silly moments we shared. I didnâ€™t realize how much comfort your presence brought until now. Thereâ€™s a space here that only you can fill, and though Iâ€™m proud of you for chasing your dreams, I canâ€™t help but feel the weight of your absence.
<br/>
Come back soon, even if just for a little while, because I miss you more than words can say."
